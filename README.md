# Towards Aggregate Computing With Machine Learning
## Case study: Hysteretic Q-Learning applied in Hop Count Problem.

This repository contains the experiments for *Towards Aggregate Computing With Machine Learning*.

For more details about Aggregate Programming, please refer to this [site](https://apice.unibo.it/xwiki/bin/view/aggregate-computing/). 
### Technology stack:
-ScaFi: A scala toolchain for Aggregate Computing.
-Alchemist: A Meta simulator used for Pervasive (large-scale) systems.
### Requirements
- gradle
- java > 11
- python > 3.8
### Run the examples
To install Gradle, please refer to the [official guide](https://gradle.org/install/).
For python, we suggest you use [virtual environments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html).
You can create a venv (with Python > 3.8) as:
```
python3 -m venv tutorial-env
```
Then, type in the root project folder:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
./simulation.sh
```
